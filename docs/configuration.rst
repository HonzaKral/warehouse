Configuration
=============

Warehouse uses a YAML based configuration format. You can specify which file to
load using either the environment variable ``WAREHOUSE_CONF`` or by using the
``-c`` option on the ``warehouse`` cli. The default configuration for Warehouse
is inside of the ``warehouse/config.yml`` file. Warehouse will do a nested
dictionary merge of the config file into the default configuration file, making
it simple to override a default setting even inside of another dictionary.


Configuration Options
---------------------

debug
~~~~~

:Type: Boolean
:Default: ``True``
:Required: No
:Description:
    Determines whether Warehouse is in debug mode or not, primarily this acts
    as an optimization in production as it turns off things like auto reloading
    of the Jinja2 templates or using the hashed filenames for static files.

site.name
~~~~~~~~~

:Type: String
:Default: ``"Warehouse"``
:Required: No
:Description:
    The name of this instance of Warehouse. This will be used in the title tags
    and headers of Warehouse.

site.hosts
~~~~~~~~~~

:Type: List
:Required: Yes
:Description:
    A list of strings that Warehouse will trust in the Host header.

site.access_token
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:Type: String
:Required: Yes
:Description:
    A string that must be sent as part of the request in order for Warehouse
    to trust the ``X-Forwarded-*`` headers sent in the request. This is
    designed to allow the Fastly CDN to "authenticate" its ``X-Forwarded-*``
    headers.

    This setting requires that any trusted front end sets a header named
    ``X-Warehouse-Access-Token`` with the value set to whatever the
    ``site.access_token`` value is. If the header is unset, or the token does
    not match, then Warehouse will strip any ``X-Forwarded-*`` headers from
    the request before processing.

:Type: URL
:Default: ``"/"``

    The base url of this Warehouse instance.
